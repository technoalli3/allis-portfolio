          About Commissions:
        </h3>
        <p>
          As of right now, I do not have a set-in-stone commissions table.
          However, I believe in fair pricing. Before any work is done, we 
          can discuss what a fair price may be. The final price will never
          stray more than $100.00 from the original estimated price, and any
          estimated changes will be communicated. Pricing bounds will vary
          based on the requested commission, and I will communicate those bounds.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          In all honesty, accepting commissions from customers
          isn't about the money. I love modeling and texturing things,
          and I do this for the experience more than anything.
        </p>

          Below is a list of my current capabilities. This may change and
          update as I gain experience through commissions.
